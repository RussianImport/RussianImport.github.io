        Our first assignment was to play with Lightbot. Lightbot is a simple game where you use logic and progmramming to stear a robot to a specific position. While it didn't have much depth, it introduced the important concepts we will be using later on.

        After Lightbot, we got more complex. Scratch is a programming language that uses connected blocks of code to manipulate sprites in a changable scene. While it's a million times more complex than lightbot, we had to use the same basic logic to program our games. The game I made is similar to the famous game Asteroid. It spawns enemies at a rate of 1 per second and you will quickly get run over if you don't kill enemies fast enough.
